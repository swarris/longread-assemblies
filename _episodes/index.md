<h4>Genetwister Technologies B.V. and Wageningen University & Research are pleased to invite you to <strong>{{page.title}}</strong>.</h4>

<h2 id="general">General Information</h2>

In this two day workshop you will learn about two most common long read sequencing technologies: Pacific Bioscience an Oxford Nanopore Technology. You will learn how to work with the data, perform assembly, mapping, and compare the results of both technologies.

<p id="who">
  <strong>Who:</strong>
  The workshop is intended for bioinformaticians or researchers who want to learn about application of latest sequencing technologies in genomics. 
  <strong>No prior experience with PacBio or ONT sequencing data is required.</strong>
