In this two day workshop you will learn about two most common long read sequencing technologies: Pacific Bioscience an Oxford Nanopore Technology. You will learn how to work with the data, perform assembly, mapping, and compare the results of both technologies.

> ## Prerequisites
>
> This two-day workshop is aimed at providing a basic understanding of creating and evaluating de novo assembly using long read technologies. The workshop requires knowledge of working with the Linux operating system and of biological topics such as genetics and DNA.
> The target audience consists of Master/PhD students or researchers working in the Life Sciences. Although the data is from a plant genome, the learned principles can be applied to many other organisms, including bacteria, fungi and mammals. 
The idea behind this workshop is that you learn the most by doing and discussing the results.
