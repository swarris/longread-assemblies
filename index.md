<h4>Genetwister Technologies B.V. and Wageningen University & Research are pleased to invite you to <strong>Long Read Sequencing Genomics Workshop</strong>.</h4>

<h2 id="general">General Information</h2>

In this two day workshop you will learn about two most common long read sequencing technologies: Pacific Bioscience an Oxford Nanopore Technology. You will learn how to work with the data, perform assembly, mapping, and compare the results of both technologies.

<p id="who">
  <strong>Who:</strong>
  The workshop is intended for bioinformaticians or researchers who want to learn about application of latest sequencing technologies in genomics. 
  <strong>No prior experience with PacBio or ONT sequencing data is required.</strong>
</p>


> ## Prerequisites
>
> This two-day workshop is aimed at providing a basic understanding of creating and evaluating de novo assembly using long read technologies. The workshop requires knowledge of working with the Linux operating system and of biological topics such as genetics and DNA.
> The target audience consists of Master/PhD students or researchers working in the Life Sciences. Although the data is from a plant genome, the learned principles can be applied to many other organisms, including bacteria, fungi and mammals. 
> The idea behind this workshop is that you learn the most by doing and discussing the results.
